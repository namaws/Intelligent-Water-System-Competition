Realtime Management of Wastewater Treatment Plants Using AI
This work introduces the Real-time AI-Driven Decision Support System (RADS). RADS is a real-time
cybersecurity, prediction, and optimization framework for Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTP). RADS
addresses the need for intelligent systems (AI-driven) to manage immense data and water flow at
facilities. We present a web-based, AI-driven framework that can be adapted and deployed to assist
multiple tasks including but not limited to, data security, reservoir water level prediction, and costefficient effluent management for pumping goals and during extreme weather conditions. RADS provides
90% protection against cyberattacks, 87% accurate prediction of peak water levels in the WWTP
reservoirs, and 27% saving on effluent release processes during extreme weather conditions. Our
simulations also showed RADS was able to predict every single overflow incident from 2018 to 2022 at
Blue Plains Advanced Wastewater Treatment Plant (DC Water).
